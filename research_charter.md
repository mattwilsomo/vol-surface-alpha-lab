## 2. One-Sentence Summary

This project builds a mathematical finance and empirical research platform that implements stochastic process simulation, option pricing, Greeks, implied-volatility inversion, volatility-surface construction, SABR calibration, and risk-neutral density extraction from first principles, then applies those tools to real option-chain and equity data to test whether mathematically derived option-surface features improve volatility forecasting, cross-sectional equity selection, drawdown control, hedging decisions, and portfolio construction.

---

## 3. Core Research Motivation

Traditional systematic equity research often uses signals such as momentum, value, quality, analyst revisions, volatility, and liquidity to forecast future stock returns. Separately, mathematical finance and derivatives research studies how option prices encode market expectations about volatility, skew, tail risk, and hedging costs.

This project is motivated by the idea that these two worlds should not be treated separately.

The options market contains forward-looking information about uncertainty, downside protection, volatility risk premia, and risk-neutral probability distributions. A traditional equity signal may look attractive in isolation, but its usefulness may depend heavily on the risk being priced in the options market.

For example:

* A stock may have strong momentum but extreme downside skew.
* A value stock may look cheap but have a risk-neutral density with a fat left tail.
* A quality stock may have stable fundamentals and relatively cheap implied volatility.
* A high-revision stock may already have uncertainty fully priced into its options.
* A portfolio may have positive expected alpha but hidden exposure to volatility shocks, skew, liquidity, or crash risk.

The central aim of this project is therefore to derive option-implied risk features from first principles and test whether they improve empirical equity and volatility research.

---

## 4. Core Research Question

Can option-surface quantities derived from first-principles pricing models improve equity selection, volatility forecasting, hedging decisions, and portfolio risk control beyond traditional equity signals and vendor-provided option fields?

---

## 5. Main Hypotheses

### H1: Volatility Forecasting Hypothesis

Option-surface features derived from cleaned option chains predict future realized volatility better than historical realized volatility alone.

Examples of relevant features:

```text
ATM implied volatility
volatility risk premium
SABR alpha
SABR nu
term structure slope
risk-neutral variance
risk-neutral kurtosis
option liquidity
```

---

### H2: Tail-Risk Hypothesis

Risk-neutral density features such as implied skewness, implied kurtosis, and left-tail probability contain useful information about future drawdowns, negative return events, and downside risk.

Examples of relevant features:

```text
risk-neutral skewness
risk-neutral kurtosis
left-tail probability
put-call skew
SABR rho
surface curvature
crash-probability proxy
```

---

### H3: Surface-Derived Feature Hypothesis

Self-derived volatility-surface features add information beyond simple vendor-provided options fields such as ATM implied volatility, raw skew, option volume, and open interest.

The key comparison is:

```text
vendor options fields
vs
self-derived implied volatility / skew / VRP
vs
SABR surface features
vs
risk-neutral density features
```

---

### H4: Equity Signal Conditioning Hypothesis

Traditional equity signals such as momentum, value, quality, reversal, and analyst revisions perform differently depending on the option-implied risk environment.

Examples:

```text
momentum × implied volatility
momentum × downside skew
value × left-tail probability
quality × volatility risk premium
analyst revisions × option-implied uncertainty
```

---

### H5: Practical Robustness Hypothesis

Any apparent benefit from option-surface features must survive realistic implementation assumptions, including liquidity filters, transaction costs, point-in-time data alignment, sector and factor risk controls, out-of-sample validation, and regime splits.

---

## 6. What This Project Is

This project is a combined mathematical finance and systematic research platform.

It has two connected halves:

```text
Half 1:
Build the mathematical machinery.

Half 2:
Use the machinery in real empirical research.
```

The mathematical machinery includes:

```text
stochastic process simulation
option pricing
Greeks
delta hedging
implied-volatility inversion
volatility smile construction
volatility surface construction
SABR calibration
Breeden-Litzenberger density extraction
risk-neutral moments
Markov volatility regimes
```

The empirical research layer includes:

```text
CRSP equity returns
OptionMetrics option chains
Compustat fundamentals
I/B/E/S analyst revisions
equity signals
option-surface signals
volatility forecasting
cross-sectional return prediction
tail-risk filtering
risk modelling
portfolio construction
transaction costs
attribution
robustness testing
```

---

## 7. What This Project Is Not

This project is not:

```text
a trading bot
a copied Black-Scholes calculator
a yfinance backtester
a pairs-trading notebook
a generic factor backtest
a random ML-on-stock-prices project
a dashboard pretending to be research
a project that blindly trusts vendor option fields
```

A standalone Black-Scholes implementation is not the final project. Black-Scholes is only the baseline used to build more serious tools such as implied-volatility inversion, Greeks, hedging-error simulations, volatility surfaces, SABR calibration, and risk-neutral density extraction.

---

## 8. Research Scope

The project focuses on US listed equities with available option-chain data.

The research will test three broad empirical applications:

1. **Volatility forecasting**

   * Can option-surface features predict future realized volatility?

2. **Cross-sectional equity selection**

   * Can option-surface features improve traditional equity alpha models?

3. **Risk and portfolio control**

   * Can option-implied tail-risk measures reduce drawdowns, improve position sizing, or improve portfolio construction?

The project may also include a hedging-error study and a Markov volatility-regime module.

```

This enables:

```text
equity returns
realized volatility
liquidity screens
option-chain cleaning

volatility forecasting
basic equity/options comparison
```

---

### 9.3 Data Added Later

forecast dispersion signals
richer equity-only baseline
```

Optional later datasets:

```text
FTSE Russell
Eventus
Factiva

```

---

### 9.4 Data Licensing Rule

Raw WRDS, CRSP, Compustat, I/B/E/S, and OptionMetrics data will not be published in the public GitHub repository.

The public repository may include:

```text
source code
configuration files
schema definitions
query templates
data dictionaries
synthetic sample data
small fake option-chain examples
generated figures
methodology notes
research reports
```

The public repository will not include:

```text
raw licensed data
full proprietary option chains
raw CRSP extracts
raw Compustat extracts
raw I/B/E/S extracts
raw OptionMetrics extracts
```

---

## 10. Initial Universe Definition

### 10.1 Base Universe

The base universe will consist of:

```text
US listed optionable equities
common shares only
NYSE / AMEX / NASDAQ listings
sufficient CRSP price history
sufficient OptionMetrics option-chain coverage
minimum stock liquidity
minimum option liquidity
```

---

### 10.2 Suggested First Empirical Universe

The first empirical universe will be:

```text
Top 500 to 1000 US stocks by rolling dollar volume among stocks with usable OptionMetrics option chains
```

This is preferred over “all stocks” because option-chain data is sparse, noisy, and liquidity-dependent.

---

### 10.3 Equity Filters

Initial equity filters:

```text
common shares only
valid CRSP identifier
valid trading date
price greater than $5
minimum 252 trading days of return history
positive rolling dollar volume
top liquidity universe by rolling ADV
exclude obvious stale-price observations
include delisting returns where applicable
```

---

### 10.4 Option Filters

Initial option-chain filters:

```text
valid underlying link
valid option type
valid expiration date
positive time to expiry
non-missing strike
non-missing bid and ask
bid >= 0
ask >= bid
positive midpoint
minimum option open interest or volume
exclude extreme implied-volatility observations
exclude options with too few days to expiry
exclude options with excessive time to expiry for baseline tests
keep liquid OTM calls and puts for surface construction
require minimum number of valid strikes per maturity
```

---

### 10.5 Initial Maturity Buckets

Initial maturity buckets:

```text
approximately 30 days
approximately 60 days
approximately 91 days
```

These may later be expanded.

---

## 11. Data Engineering Principles

The data pipeline must enforce:

```text
point-in-time alignment
security identifier mapping
date alignment
data availability dates
signal availability dates
portfolio formation dates
execution dates
return realization dates
survivorship-bias control
lookahead-bias prevention
data-quality auditing
reproducibility
```

The key timing rule is:

```text
signal_date < portfolio_formation_date < execution_date < return_realization_date
```

No same-close execution assumption should be used unless explicitly labelled as a non-tradable diagnostic.

---

### 13.5 Breeden-Litzenberger Risk-Neutral Density Extraction

Concept:

```text

## 18. Model Comparison Framework

### 18.1 Main Models

| Model | Inputs                                 | Purpose                                      |

| M7    | Full model with risk filter            | Practical implementation model               |

---

### 18.2 Initial Model Types

Initial models:

```text
equal-weight composite score
cross-sectional OLS
ridge regression
lasso regression
logistic regression for tail-event prediction
```

Optional later models:

```text
gradient boosting
random forest
```

Deep learning will not be used unless there is a clear reason.

---

### 18.3 Validation Design

The project will use time-aware validation.

Allowed validation methods:

```text
walk-forward validation
rolling training window
expanding training window
out-of-sample test period
regime split testing
```

Not allowed:

```text
random train/test split across dates
tuning on the final test set
using future fundamentals
using same-day close execution unless labelled non-tradable
using today’s identifiers for historical security mapping without point-in-time checks
```

---

## 19. Risk Model

The risk model will decompose stock returns into systematic and residual components.

Model form:

```text
stock return = market + sector + style factors + residual
```

Candidate factors:

```text
market
sector / industry
size
value
momentum
quality
volatility
liquidity
option-implied volatility factor
```

Outputs:

```text
factor exposures
factor returns
specific returns
factor covariance
specific risk
portfolio predicted volatility
factor contribution to risk
specific contribution to risk
```

Purpose:

```text
ensure that apparent alpha is not merely hidden exposure to market beta, sector, size, volatility, liquidity, or other systematic factors
```

---

## 20. Portfolio Construction

### 20.1 Portfolio Objective

The portfolio optimizer will conceptually solve:

```text
maximize expected alpha
minus risk penalty
minus transaction cost penalty
minus tail-risk penalty
```

Mathematical form:

```text
maximize: alphaᵀw - λ wᵀΣw - cost(w - w_prev) - γ tail_risk(w)
```

---

### 20.2 Constraints

Candidate constraints:

```text
dollar neutrality
beta neutrality
sector bounds
max single-name position
max gross exposure
max net exposure
liquidity-scaled position limits
turnover cap
option-data coverage requirement
tail-risk exposure limit
minimum diversification
```

---

### 20.3 Portfolio Variants

Portfolio variants:

```text
P1: naive long-short decile portfolio
P2: risk-neutralized long-short portfolio
P3: cost-aware optimized portfolio
P4: options-informed risk-filtered portfolio
P5: full surface-derived optimized portfolio
```

Purpose:

```text
show the path from raw signal to implementable portfolio
```

---

## 21. Transaction Cost Model

### 21.1 Base Cost Model

Initial cost model:

```text
cost_i = fixed_bps + spread_bps_i + impact_coeff * volatility_i * sqrt(order_size_i / ADV_i)
```

Where:

```text
fixed_bps = baseline fixed trading cost
spread_bps_i = bid-ask spread proxy
impact_coeff = assumed market-impact coefficient
volatility_i = recent realized volatility
order_size_i = dollar value traded
ADV_i = average daily dollar volume
```

---

### 21.2 Cost Stress Tests

The project will test:

```text
0 bps
5 bps
10 bps
25 bps
2x base cost
5x base cost
```

The purpose is not to claim the exact cost model is correct. The purpose is to test whether results survive plausible cost assumptions.

---

### 21.3 Cost Outputs

Outputs:

```text
gross return
net return
turnover
cost drag
capacity proxy
participation rate
implementation shortfall
```

---

## 22. Backtesting Design

The backtester will be calendar-driven.

Backtest loop:

```text
for each rebalance date:
    define eligible universe
    load only data known as of that date
    compute equity signals
    compute options signals
    generate forecasts
    estimate risk
    optimize portfolio
    simulate trades at next tradable date
    subtract transaction costs
    record returns, holdings, trades, exposures
```

Critical timing rule:

```text
signal_date < portfolio_formation_date < execution_date < return_realization_date
```

Outputs:

```text
holdings
trades
daily returns
monthly returns
turnover
transaction costs
factor exposures
sector exposures
drawdowns
attribution
```

---

## 23. Attribution

The attribution system will decompose performance into:

```text
equity signal contribution
vendor option signal contribution
self-derived IV/skew/VRP contribution
SABR signal contribution
density signal contribution
market beta contribution
sector contribution
style factor contribution
volatility exposure contribution
tail-risk filter contribution
transaction cost drag
turnover drag
long book contribution
short book contribution
```

Questions attribution should answer:

```text
Did options data add return?
Did options data reduce drawdown?
Did SABR features matter, or only simple IV?
Did density features help avoid crashes?
Was improvement just lower beta?
Was improvement just lower volatility exposure?
Did transaction costs erase the benefit?
Was performance concentrated in one regime?
```

---

## 24. Robustness and Falsification

### 24.1 Data Robustness

Test:

```text
different equity liquidity thresholds
different option open-interest filters
different moneyness windows
different maturity buckets
large-cap only universe
high-option-liquidity universe
excluding earnings periods
excluding low-price stocks
excluding low-volume stocks
```

---

### 24.2 Model Robustness

Test:

```text
vendor IV only
self-derived IV only
SABR only
density only
combined options model
equity-only model
options-only model
no equity signals
no options signals
```

---

### 24.3 Time Robustness

Test across:

```text
pre-crisis periods
crisis periods
post-crisis periods
COVID period
high-rate period
low-volatility regimes
high-volatility regimes
```

Exact periods will be determined by data availability and final sample window.

---

### 24.4 Cost Robustness

Test:

```text
zero costs
base costs
2x costs
5x costs
```

---

### 24.5 Placebo Tests

Placebo tests:

```text
shuffle option signals cross-sectionally
lag option signals incorrectly as a negative control
random portfolios with the same turnover
randomized tail-risk filter
same equity model with fake option features
```

---

### 24.6 Statistical Robustness

Statistical checks:

```text
rolling IC
rank IC stability
bootstrap confidence intervals
Sharpe confidence intervals
multiple-testing log
deflated Sharpe ratio if feasible
```

---

## 25. Rejection Criteria

The options-surface layer should be rejected or downgraded if:

```text
it only improves in-sample performance
it fails out of sample
it only works in illiquid option names
it is subsumed by simple realized volatility
it is subsumed by beta, size, sector, or liquidity exposure
it adds turnover without improving net performance
it improves raw return but worsens drawdown materially
it depends on unstable SABR calibration parameters
it fails under alternative option filters
it fails under alternative date ranges
it fails under realistic transaction cost assumptions
it cannot be explained economically
```

A negative result is acceptable if it is well-documented.

The goal is not to force the strategy to work. The goal is to test whether mathematically derived option-surface features contain robust, useful information.

---

## 26. Known Limitations

Expected limitations:

```text
OptionMetrics data access and licensing constraints
single-name option data can be sparse and noisy
SABR calibration may be unstable for illiquid names
risk-neutral density extraction is sensitive to smoothing
transaction cost model is approximate
shorting costs may be simplified or excluded initially
fundamental data availability assumptions may be conservative but imperfect
earnings dates and event effects may require separate handling
results may be universe-dependent
results may be regime-dependent
surface-derived features may not beat simpler vendor fields
```

These limitations should be reported explicitly rather than hidden.

## 33. Final Research Comparison

The final empirical comparison is:

```text
Equity-only model
vs
Equity + vendor options fields
vs
Equity + self-derived IV/skew/VRP
vs
Equity + SABR surface features
vs
Equity + risk-neutral density features
```

This comparison preserves the systematic equity research project while adding the mathematical finance depth required for options and market-making relevance.

---

## 34. Success Criteria

The project is successful if it can answer, with evidence:

```text
whether self-derived implied volatility matches vendor implied volatility
whether option-surface features forecast realized volatility
whether option-surface features improve equity return prediction
whether tail-risk features reduce drawdowns
whether advanced features beat simple vendor options fields
whether results survive liquidity filters
whether results survive transaction costs
whether results survive out-of-sample validation
whether the mathematical models are stable enough to be useful
```

The project does not require a profitable strategy to be successful.

A mature negative result is acceptable.

---

## 35. Expected Interview Explanation

### 30-Second Explanation

```text
I built a volatility-surface research platform that connects mathematical finance with systematic equity research. First, I implemented stochastic process simulators, option pricers, Greeks, implied-volatility solvers, volatility surfaces, SABR calibration, and risk-neutral density extraction from first principles. Then I applied those tools to real option-chain and equity data to test whether derived option-implied features improve volatility forecasting, cross-sectional equity selection, tail-risk control, and portfolio construction.
```

---

### 2-Minute Explanation

```text
The project has two layers. The first is a mathematical finance layer, where I build the option-pricing and volatility tools myself: Black-Scholes, binomial trees, Monte Carlo pricing, Greeks, delta-hedging simulations, implied-volatility inversion, surface construction, SABR calibration, and Breeden-Litzenberger density extraction. The second layer is an empirical research platform using CRSP, OptionMetrics, Compustat, and I/B/E/S data. I compare equity-only models against models that use vendor options fields and models that use my own surface-derived features. The main question is whether mathematically derived option-implied risk measures add useful information for volatility forecasting, equity selection, drawdown control, and portfolio construction after controlling for liquidity, transaction costs, factor risk, and out-of-sample validation.
```

---

## 36. Final Positioning

This project is designed to signal four abilities at once:

```text
1. Mathematical finance ability:
   I can implement stochastic and option-pricing models from first principles.

2. Empirical research ability:
   I can test hypotheses using real financial data without lookahead or survivorship bias.

3. Portfolio/risk ability:
   I understand risk models, transaction costs, attribution, and implementation constraints.

4. Software engineering ability:
   I can build a modular, tested, reproducible research codebase.
```

The project is not simply:

```text
an equity backtest plus an option pricer
```

It is:

```text
a system for deriving option-implied beliefs from market prices and testing whether those beliefs matter in real empirical research
```

That is the central identity of the project.
